		<h1> BOB ROSS </h1>
<p> If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.</p> 

<p>The light is your friend. Preserve it. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. See there how easy that is. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. </p>

<p>Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. </p>

<p>That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Do an almighty painting with us. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. </p>

<p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Be brave. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. </p>

<p>Son of a gun. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. </p>

<p>I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. You need the dark in order to show the light. Anything you want to do you can do here. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. </p>
